NOTES for how the database works:::::::::

::VERBOSE:::
user = User.new
user.name = "Kirby"
user.save

topic = Topic.new
topic.title = "Some cool title"
topic.user = user
topic.save

photo = Photo.new
photo.image_url = "something.img"
photo.topic = topic
photo.save

statement = Statement.new
statement.content = "A really cool statement to go along with my topic"
statement.topic = topic
statement.save

::Test that Associations worked:::
user.statements
(((This Should show that users statements)))



::: LESS VERBOSE ::::

user2 = User.create(name: "John")
topic2 = Topic.create(title: "Some Other Cool Title", user: user2)
photo2 = Photo.create(image_url: "Coolpic.img", topic: topic2)
statement2 = Statement.create(content: "Sweet Tent", topic: topic2)
statement3 = Statement.create(content: "Another Tent", topic: topic2)

::: Test & Examples that its working :::
user2.statements.order(:content)
user2.statements.order(content: :desc)
user2.topics
Topic.find_by user_id: 2
Topic.where("user_id = 1")
user2.statements.where("topic_id = 2")

For the project- Build a link on the start page to log in with the test
account, which will be pre-loaded with topics and content.

Also, iterate through image files as a recommendation on the new photos form page
