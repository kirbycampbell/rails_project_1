# README

I will be building a Rails app that incorporates users and login abilities.

Once logged in, users can add a new topic (like mountains):

Once in their new topic, the user can add a photo url, statement, or both.  

The User will then see a list of all of their topics, and can click into a topic to see a list of posts within a topic.

The user can set it to private or not, requiring another user to be a member as well to view, or not.

The user can also then edit, update, and or destroy their topics or posts.

Practice some CSS while building this as well.
